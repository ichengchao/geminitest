# Gemini Project Configuration

This file, `GEMINI.md`, helps the Gemini agent understand and interact with your project more effectively.

You can add project-specific details here, such as:

- Build and run commands
- Testing procedures
- Preferred libraries and coding styles
- Important file locations
- General instructions for how Gemini should behave in this project

The more context you provide, the better Gemini can assist you.
